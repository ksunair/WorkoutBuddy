Why
---

Recently I started a work out plan. I met a trainer and he gave the plan in a paper. As he was going through
        what I need to do, all I could think of is, who will be using paper in this time and age.
            * Build an end to end using Meteor.
            * Build and deploy a mobile application.
            * Use my iphone for work out instead of carrying a paper.
            * Create monthly work out plan and send update to the trainer.
            * May be sell the software back to the trainer and get my money back. :)
