Workout Buddy

Why
---

Recently I started a work out plan. I met a trainer and he gave the plan in a paper. As he was going through
what I need to do, all I could think of is, who will be using paper in this time and age. So here are the reasons
for why am I doing this?

* Build an end to end using Meteor.
* Build and deploy a mobile application.
* Use my iphone for work out instead of carrying a paper.
* Create monthly work out plan and send update to the trainer.
* May be sell the software back to the trainer and get my money back. :)

Framework

This is developed with MeteorJS as I said in Why section.
